		<p class="project-description">Paper Hands is a paper trade web application, that simulates buying stocks. You can register, login and manage your portfolio by buying and sell stocks.</p>
		<p class="project-description">It integrates with a third-party API (<a href="https://financialmodelingprep.com/">financialmodelingprep.com</a>) to get the current stockprices at the moment of every buy/sell operation in the backend and automatically updates your Account Balance accordingly. It also features API endpoints itself to buy/sell.</p>
		<p class="project-description">The application was built as a proof-of-concept and could be expanded by a graphical representation of the current stock prices, functioning authentication for the API (right now only frontend authentication is implemented), and definitely a whole lot of other features, but I was satisfied with it as a weekend project.</p>

		<p class="project-description">This project I did for a small startup, which is still in active development. Its intended as a SaaS marketplace web application. I did the design in Figma and started building out the frontend with React and TailwindCSS.</p>
		<p class="project-description">Right now only the landingpage is (quite) finished yet, but I started designing the UI for the marketplace functionality as well as already planned the architecture on how the frontend is going to communicate with a Laravel backend, separating those two for better maintainability and trying to incorporate best practices into my architecture design.</p>
		<p class="project-description">The website is hosted via DigitalOcean and I started incorporating testing into it (although there is not much to test yet) and got a CI/CD process going that kicks off the test suite, formatting, linting and the build process via pre-commit hooks and Husky, but also on the branches itself via CircleCI.</p>

		<p class="project-description">The KlimfAb Consultingtool was made in cooperation with 15 german sewage associations as a funded government project. </p>

		<p class="project-description">The tool offers possibility to save and evaluate the results and compare different variations of the answered qestions. Answers are automatically saved in a database. Also the tool offers a knowledge base that was created with the help of domain specialists, that already use this tool to evaluate their companies infrastructure and situation.</p>
		<p class="project-description">Because the project is still in testing phase with its early adopters, an open access to the site is unfortunately not possible yet.</p>
