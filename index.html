            <p>Dr. Anna Mester’s extensive academic experience spans roles in teaching, research, and faculty development. </p>
            <p>As an educator, she advocates for multilingual, immigrant, and first-generation students, while working to advance equity-driven initiatives at an institutional level. She has also worked in faculty development roles, supporting faculty, postdocs, and graduate students with drafting compelling funding proposals, ethically engaging with community partners, as well as effectively communicating research with community partners and public audiences.</p>
            <p>Anna’s work is influenced by her extensive experience abroad. As a practitioner of community engagement, she facilitated creative writing and arts workshops in prisons in Michigan and Brazil. Previously a Fulbright-Hays Scholar in Mozambique, Spain, and Portugal, her travels and research also included field work in Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Brazil. These experiences continue to inspire her multicultural and pluralistic approach to her work.</p>
            <p>She is fluent in 4 languages and holds a B.A. <i>summa cum laude</i> in Romance Languages and Cultures and Critical Social Thought from <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/">Mount Holyoke College</a>. She earned her Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures with an African Studies concentration from the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>.</p>
            <p>In her free time, Anna enjoys reading, writing, sewing, and folk embroidery–and when the weather is nice she goes gravel cycling and bike packing. </p>
